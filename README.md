# Smart-conomique-Bionic-Leg-System
The project emphasizes on providing value for money by using a bionic leg for sprinters embedded with smart monitoring system. In this project our main focus is to build a smart bionic leg system using basic prosthetic leg and maintaining its quality at the same time by installing a monitoring system which uses components like accelerometer and flex sensor to imitate the other leg's movement and gives signal to the microcontroller unit which is the heart of the system.These Bionic legs are cost friendly and have flexible joints instead of motors so they eliminate the stress caused due to vibration and the user can experience a natural feel instead of an artificial one due to the imitation system.Thus this product is cost friendly and user effective in terms of performance and its calibration can be modified anytime for the benefit of the users.
