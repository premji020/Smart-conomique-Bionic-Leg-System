# Smart-economique-Bionic-Leg-System
The project emphasizes on providing value for money by using a bionic leg for sprinters embedded with smart monitoring system. In this project our main focus is to build a smart bionic leg system using basic prosthetic leg and maintaining its quality at the same time by installing a monitoring system which uses components like accelerometer and flex sensor to imitate the other leg's movement and gives signal to the microcontroller unit which is the heart of the system.These Bionic legs are cost friendly and have flexible joints instead of motors so they eliminate the stress caused due to vibration and the user can experience a natural feel instead of an artificial one due to the imitation system.Thus this product is cost friendly and user effective in terms of performance and its calibration can be modified anytime for the benefit of the users.

#Need for Bionic Systems

People have always have a craze towards fitness and sports. Ultimately it has lead to the development of sports and several sports are played at international level. It provides entertainment for fans and gives out the importance of physical activities. The tragic part is that some people lose their limbs in accidents and have to lead their life with many difficulties. But Engineers had innovated a new technology known as bionic systems that are artificial/ biological transforms of electro-mechanical systems designed in order to regain their original functionalities.


#Disadvantages

Since its development people have raised lot of doubts regarding its functionality that these bionic systems could help people will it make the player regain his original abilities or boost with artificial technologies that makes them even better than normal individuals such as giving extra thrust during play. This has been a great issue in recent days and people need to know the exact capacity of the players.

The major disadvantage of these systems are they are either developed with an hydraulic system or a micro-controller based system with motorized control that imparts artificial pressure than normal leg. It also provides stress on the knee joints during the long run that makes uncomfortable for the athletes to wear it for a prolonged period. Moreover they are costly as they are manufactured using carbon fiber.

#Proposed Solution

We are developing a 60$ bionic leg fused with smart system that comprises of micro-controller and sensors to monitor the performance instantly. Instead of using high cost carbon fibre we are using silicon rubber as an alternative that has almost similar characteristics of light weight and great strength. This silicon rubber is made into a mold for housing the knee joint(amputated region). The bottom portion of this joint is connected to a shoe by means of a industrial grade steel rod. A flexible joint is provided in between the rod and the silicon rubber mold regulating movements with ease. The hollow cylindrical stainless steel section provides good strength and rigidity to athletes performance. Although it adds weight to the whole system we have reduced it by 75% by making it hollow and reducing its thickness as much as possible.

We are also using a accelerometer and flex sensor that are attached to particle photon that transmits data wirelessly to cloud or mobile app for easy visualization of data. Since both the legs will have same properties they are mirror image of another one. First we will measure the activities such as aceleration and flexibility during various events such as walking, running, jogging etc,. by attaching the module to normal leg. It will be attached to the bionic leg after testing it with normal leg. And using these parameters the player will train to imitate the normal leg. Flex sensor will make sure that the flexible joint will not move further after measuring the limits from normal leg. 

This will help athletes to regain their original experience that was before losing their leg and helps them to train much better.

#Future Plan

We are aiming to reduce the cost of sensors and microcontroller by designing in custom mode with only required materials. This will reduce the cost upto 15$ and will result in reduction of size and weight to a great extent.
